# TerrainGen
Minecraft Terrain generation


There are 3 main functions:

The first one generates a random terrain using OpenSimplex.
The second generates a random terrain using Perlin Noise.
The third generates terrain from an image source. 

Because the gen.mcfuntion will probably be over 65000 lines, you have to run this command in game: /gamerule maxcommandchainlength 100000000
